 				<h2><b>Support</b></h2>
				<p style="font-size:15px;">If you are having any difficulty implementing the plugin I would first recommend reading the content in the tutorial tab of this section. If you have questions about implementation or styling that are not addressed in the documentation please feel free to drop me a line via the plugin page on WordPress.org. Furthermore, if you have feedback or feature requests I would love to hear from you as well.</p>
                
				<h2><b>About the Author</b></h2>
				<p style="font-size:15px;">My name is Rob Smelik. I am an Art Director, Designer and Developer with nearly 20 years of experience in the Visual Communications industry. I started working on Wordpress in 2007 and it soon became my CMS of choice. Having used it on everything from personal projects to large client sites I've taught myself to squeeze every bit of functionality out of it's framework.</p>
                
                <h2><b>About the Plugin</b></h2>
				<p style="font-size:15px;">Not too long ago, while working on a client membership site, I wrote a script for displaying content based on a user roles. Since that time I have reused it on many other projects. Finally frustrated by having to dig into the code every time I needed it, I decided to write a plugin. If you already run a membership site this plugin is an absolute must have. If you don't and figured it was too difficult to set up, this is certainly a good addition to the functionality of other membership plugins.</p><br/>
