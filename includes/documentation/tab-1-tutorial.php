				<h2><b>Step 1:</b> Add Widgets to the User Role Widget Areas</h2>
				<p>First you need to add some widgets to the newly registered <b>User Role Widget Areas</b>. To do this go to the <a href="widgets.php">Widgets</a> area in your Appearance menu. There you will find <b>five</b> new widget areas based on the default WordPress user roles: <b>Subscriber, Contributor, Author, Editor and Administrator</b>.  
                Simply open the widget areas and drag a widget into each of them. To test the functionality of the plugin we recommend dragging a text widget into these areas and giving them a title them based on the specific role such as "Administrator Area". That way you can easily disginquish which role is being displayed. Once you have a feel for how the plugin works you can customize it however you want. (Note: Be sure to save you widget settings.) </p>

                <h2><b>Step 2:</b> Activate the User Role Widget Areas</h2>
				<p>To activate your <b>User Role Widget Areas</b> and display them on your public site you simply need to drag the provided <b>URWA - Users by Role</b> widget into any <b>NON-USER</b> widget area where you want to display the content. For most themes this would be the main sidebar or footer widget areas. If you drag the display widget into one of the <b>User Role Widget Areas</b> your content <b>WILL NOT show up</b>. The widget may however, be placed in <b>Users - Logged In</b> widget area as long as that area is activated first (refer to step 4).</p>
