### Installation

2. Install and activate the plugin using the built in WordPress plugin installer.

4. Drag the installed URWA display widgets to the sidebar or widget area where you want your user role based widgets to appear.
5. Refresh your public site to see role based widgets and log out or log in as a different user role to see the widgets change. 


### Additional Usage - Shortcodes

Two shortcodes come installed with this plugin.

The following shortcode will display the role based widgets that you have defined on the Appearance > Widgets page in WordPress:

[user-role-widgets] 

The following shortcode will display the User - Logged In widget area:

[user-logged-in-widgets] 

### Additional Usage - Hardcoding

You can also hardcode the dynamic widget areas into your theme using the following PHP code.

The following code will display the role based widgets that you have defined on the Appearance > Widgets page in WordPress when placed in your theme:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[user-role-widgets]'); ?>` 


The following code will display the User - Logged In widget area when placed in your theme:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[user-logged-in-widgets]'); ?>` 

### Advanced Styling

Each role based widget area gets wrapped in a unique ID allowing advanced users to individually style the widget areas. For more information on styling please reference the plugin documentation link which appears in the Settings menu after activation.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### FAQ

** Q: ** I dragged widgets into the User Role Widget Areas but they are not showing up on the front end. Why?

** A: ** You must make sure that you have placed the “URWA - Users By Role” widget into any existing NON-USER widget area where you want to display specific widgets based on user roles.

** Q: ** I did the step above but the User Role widgets are still not showing up.

** A: ** Make sure you have at least one widget in the widget area for the role you are logged in as. For example: If you are logged in as an administrator drag a text widget into the Users - Administrators widget area and give it a title and some placeholder content. Go back to your browser and refresh.
